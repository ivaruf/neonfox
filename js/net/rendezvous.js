/*
 * rendezvous.js — how two browsers find each other.
 *
 * The game itself never goes through any of this. Once the data channels are
 * up, peers talk directly and none of it is involved again — which is also
 * why a broker being down only stops *new* games from starting.
 *
 * Three ways, tried in this order (hub CLAUDE.md §8):
 *
 *   relay    an explicit meta[name="signal-url"], if you want to run your own.
 *   broker   PeerJS's public broker. Nothing of ours runs anywhere, which is
 *            the whole point on GitHub Pages: there is no server to wake.
 *   tabs     BroadcastChannel. Reaches other tabs in this browser and nothing
 *            else, so it is a last resort and the lobby says so rather than
 *            looking broken.
 *
 * WHY PEERJS ONLY CARRIES SIGNALLING HERE. fishtank uses a PeerJS data
 * connection as the game connection, and pays for it with a single reliable
 * lane on the broker path — its two-lane code only runs over the relay. A
 * PeerJS connection is reliable or, at best, unordered-but-still-retransmitted;
 * there is no maxRetransmits: 0 to be had through it. So this file uses the
 * broker connection as a pipe for OFFER/ANSWER/ICE and nothing else, and every
 * tier then negotiates the same RTCPeerConnection with the same two lanes
 * webrtc.js builds. The cost is real and worth naming: two WebRTC handshakes
 * instead of one, so joining through the broker takes a second or so longer.
 * The gain is that the lane rules in protocol.js are true everywhere, rather
 * than true on one transport and quietly not on the one everybody uses.
 *
 * A public broker is a real trade, stated plainly:
 *   - a third party with no promises. Down means no new games; games already
 *     connected are untouched, because it carries no game traffic.
 *   - it sees room codes and connection metadata. It never sees game data.
 *   - no TURN, so a minority of network situations fail to connect at all.
 * Against that, it needs nothing running and nothing paid for.
