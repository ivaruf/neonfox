/*
 * webrtc.js — the actual connection, and the two lanes on it.
 *
 * Everything above this file talks to "channels": anything with
 * send(value, fast), onMessage and onClose. That keeps host.js and guest.js
 * innocent of WebRTC entirely, and it is why the same protocol runs over a
 * real RTCDataChannel, over BroadcastChannel between two tabs, or over a fake
 * pair in a test.
 *
 * Signalling is deliberately pluggable, because signalling is the only part a
 * static site on GitHub Pages cannot do by itself. Two transports live here —
 * BroadcastChannel and a WebSocket relay — and rendezvous.js adds a third by
 * borrowing a public broker's connection purely as a pipe for the messages
 * below. All three carry the same plain objects.
 *
 * TWO LANES, and which is which is not a tuning decision (hub CLAUDE.md §8):
 *
 *   "game"  ordered, reliable. Joins, roster, round events, trail points.
 *   "fast"  ordered: false, maxRetransmits: 0. State frames and input, both
 *           of which are replaced sixty times a second.
 *
 * `send(value, fast)` takes the lane as an argument rather than inferring it
 * from the value's type. Trail points are binary and must not be lost, so a
 * codec that guessed "binary means lossy" would quietly drop the one thing in
 * this game you can die on.
